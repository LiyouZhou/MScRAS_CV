  abstract = {Discriminating value crops from weeds is an important task in precision agriculture. In this paper, we propose a novel image processing pipeline based on attribute morphology for both the segmentation and classification tasks. The commonly used approaches for vegetation segmentation often rely on thresholding techniques which reach their decisions globally. By contrast, the proposed method works with connected components obtained by image threshold decomposition, which are naturally nested in a hierarchical structure called the max-tree, and various attributes calculated from these regions. Image segmentation is performed by attribute filtering, preserving or discarding the regions based on their attribute value and allowing for the decision to be reached locally. This segmentation method naturally selects a collection of foreground regions rather than pixels, and the same data structure used for segmentation can be further reused to provide the features for classification, which is realised in our experiments by a support vector machine (SVM). We apply our methods to normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) images, and demonstrate the performance of the pipeline on a dataset collected by the authors in an onion field, as well as a publicly available dataset for sugar beets. The results show that the proposed segmentation approach can segment the fine details of plant regions locally, in contrast to the state-of-the-art thresholding methods, while providing discriminative features which enable efficient and competitive classification rates for crop/weed discrimination.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

  abstract = {Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

  abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

  abstract = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the “state-transition” method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.}

  abstract = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.},

  abstract = {The Max-Tree designed for morphological attribute filtering in image processing, is a data structure in which the nodes represent connected components for all threshold levels in a data set. Attribute filters compute some attribute describing the shape or size of each connected component and then decide which components to keep or to discard. In this paper, we augment the basic Max-Tree data structure such that interactive volumetric filtering and visualization becomes possible. We introduce extensions that allow (1) direct, splatting-based, volume rendering; (2) representation of the Max-Tree on graphics hardware; and (3) fast active cell selection for isosurface generation. In all three cases, we can use the Max-Tree representation for visualization directly, without needing to reconstruct the volumetric data explicitly. We show that both filtering and visualization can be performed at interactive frame rates, ranging between 2.4 and 32 frames per seconds. In contrast, a standard texture-based volume visualization method manages only between 0.5 and 1.8 frames per second. For isovalue browsing, the experimental results show that the performance is comparable to the performance of an interval tree, where our method has the advantage that both filter threshold browsing and isolevel browsing are fast. It is shown that the methods using graphics hardware can be extended to other connected filters.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a new circularity measure which defines the degree to which a shape differs from a perfect circle. The new measure is easy to compute and, being area based, is robust—e.g., with respect to noise or narrow intrusions. Also, it satisfies the following desirable properties:•it ranges over (0,1] and gives the measured circularity equal to 1 if and only if the measured shape is a circle;•it is invariant with respect to translations, rotations and scaling. Compared with the most standard circularity measure, which considers the relation between the shape area and the shape perimeter, the new measure performs better in the case of shapes with boundary defects (which lead to a large increase in perimeter) and in the case of compound shapes. In contrast to the standard circularity measure, the new measure depends on the mutual position of the components inside a compound shape. Also, the new measure performs consistently in the case of shapes with very small (i.e., close to zero) measured circularity. It turns out that such a property enables the new measure to measure the linearity of shapes. In addition, we propose a generalisation of the new measure so that shape circularity can be computed while controlling the impact of the relative position of points inside the shape. An additional advantage of the generalised measure is that it can be used for detecting small irregularities in nearly circular shapes damaged by noise or during an extraction process in a particular image processing task.},
